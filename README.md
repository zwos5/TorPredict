# Tornadics
Tornadics is a terminal application for making an unofficial prediction of a tornado's EF level based on the highest windspeed.

## How To Use
Simply load up the code files into your IDE or another available terminal.  If you wish to run a test manually, simply type "No" when asked if you have a file to load by the program otherwise type "Yes".  

If you wish to use a file make sure the first number is how many tornadoes you want to check and then enter windspeeds on each subsequent line.  Once entered, the program will run the values through and match them to the assigned EF value.  Once the EF values have been assigned the program will display a tornado total by each level.
