Hi there user.
Hello, I am good.
I'm doing good, how about you?
What would you like to know about?
Rain is water that has accumulated up in the atmosphere of the earth that falls when it gets heavy.
A thunderstorm occurs when the air is humid and hot or cold air moves in to an area where it currently hot/cold depending on the season.
A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that happens when two different air temperatures begin blowing in opposite directions.
Snow is like rain in a frozen form.
A windy day occurs when air begins moving at a quick rate of speed.
Hail is rain that has frozen up in the atmosphere during a thunderstorm.
A hurricane is similar in ways to a tornado. However, hurricanes are characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and squalls.
My name is Tornadics.ai I can tell you about the weather.
Not at this time but maybe in the future.
As a robot I do not look too much into manners as long as I know I am being helpful that is what counts.
You're welcome user, glad I could help.
